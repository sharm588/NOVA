/* Example for changing the dark parts of an image.
 * Move the mouse from left to right to see different intensity
 * or press the left mouse button to see the original image.
 *
 * In the middle position the image is unchanged. Move the mouse 
 * in the left area of the image the dark parts will be 
 * more dark and the right area you will lift up the shadows.
 *
 * You want more? See the Lights.apply() for doing the same in the highlights.
