/* Example for changing the light parts of an image.
 * Move the mouse from left to right to see different intensity
 * or press the left mouse button to see the original image.
 *
 * In the middle position the image is unchanged. Move the mouse 
 * in the left area of the image the light parts will be 
 * more dark and the right area you will lift up the lights.
 *
 * You want more? See the Shadows.apply() for doing the same in the shadows.
